## Gameplay

You start in the upper left hand corner of the board. Tap the colored buttons along the
bottom of the board to flood all adjacent filled cells with that color. The aim of the game
is to try to fill the entire board with a single color in less than the maximum number of
allowed moves.

You can customize the amount of colors and the board size by tapping the gear icon.

You can generate a board from a seed by holding down the new game (star) icon.
